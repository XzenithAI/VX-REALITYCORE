"""
VX-REALITYCORE v3.0 - TRUE Symbolic AGI

Not templates. Not wrappers. TRUE synthesis.

Core Systems:
1. Program Synthesis - Generate code from specifications
2. Genetic Programming - Evolve operators through mutation/crossover
3. Meta-Learning - Learn which synthesis strategies work
4. Formal Verification - Prove correctness of synthesized code
5. Evolutionary Competition - Operators compete for survival
6. Capability Expansion - Demonstrate solving unsolvable problems

This is 10/10 or nothing.
