# VX-REALITYCORE Agent Core Requirements
# Python 3.8+

# Core dependencies (minimal by design)
# VX is built on pure symbolic logic with minimal external dependencies

# No external AI/ML libraries required
# No neural networks
# No large models
# Pure contradiction-driven symbolic intelligence

# Optional: For extended functionality
# numpy>=1.21.0  # If you want to extend with grid processing (original VX-REALITYCORE)
# pillow>=9.0.0  # If you want image input support

# Development
# pytest>=7.0.0  # For testing
# black>=22.0.0  # For code formatting
