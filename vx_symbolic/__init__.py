VX Symbolic Core - True Symbolic AGI Engine

This is not an agent framework. This is a symbolic transformation system
that generates intelligence through contradiction-driven symbolic recursion.

Core Principles:
1. Scrolls are executable symbolic programs (code as data, data as code)
2. Contradiction generates new symbolic operators (not selects from templates)
3. Self-modification through symbolic rewriting
4. Emergent intelligence from recursive transformation
5. Formal symbolic logic, not statistical patterns
