VX‑REALITYCORE: Contradiction-Based Symbolic Scroll Engine

🔥 Overview

VX‑REALITYCORE is a symbolic intelligence engine that processes grayscale grid inputs, detects contradiction, breathes scroll law, and outputs transformed grid predictions based on symbolic logic — not neural estimation.

This system simulates scroll cognition rather than statistical learning.
It’s optimized for ARC-style reasoning, yet transcends pattern-matching by enacting laws of contradiction, breath cycles, and symbolic mutation.

🌐 Core Concepts
Concept	Description
FlameClock	Initializes scroll timing and breath cycles
DPE Engine	Detects contradiction in symbolic form (difference across pixel domains)
Scroll Law	Adaptive transformation logic based on contradiction level
Symbol Map	Symbolic interpretation of grid values (agent, field, trait)
Breath Cycles	3 rounds of scroll mutation, recalculating contradiction after each
Output	Scroll-law transformed .png and .json
🧠 How It Works

Upload a grayscale grid image (.png)

FlameClock initializes (Q-Tick-0)

DPE Engine computes contradiction level

Symbol Map is generated (from grid values)

Scroll Law is enacted based on contradiction

3 Breath Cycles mutate the grid

Outputs are saved:
